## Feature Implementation Checklist

This checklist provides a phased approach to implementing advanced features, building upon the current codebase.

### Phase 1: Enhance Core Functionality

*This phase focuses on improving existing features for a better user experience.*

-   **[ ] Search & Discovery:**
    -   [ ] **Autocomplete Search:** Enhance the `SearchBar` to show movie poster thumbnails and release years in the suggestions dropdown.
    -   [ ] **Advanced Filtering:** Add filters on the search results page for `release year`, `rating`, and `runtime`. This will involve state management in `HomePage.jsx` and parameter adjustments in `tmdbService.js`.
    -   [ ] **"Where to Watch" Integration:** On the `MovieDetailsPage.jsx`, add a section that displays streaming provider information by integrating a service like JustWatch or using the TMDB `/watch/providers` endpoint.
-   **[ ] UI/UX Refinements:**
    -   [ ] **Skeleton Loading Screens:** Replace the single `LoadingSpinner` with `SkeletonCard` components in `MovieGrid.jsx` to create a more polished loading effect that mimics the page layout.
    -   [ ] **Consistent "Add to Favorites" Button:** Create a dedicated `FavoriteButton` component that can be used on `MovieCard.jsx` and `MovieDetailsPage.jsx` to show a consistent state (add/remove).
    -   [ ] **Improved Error Handling:** Display more user-friendly error messages for different API failure scenarios (e.g., network error vs. API key issue).

### Phase 2: Introduce Personalization & User Interaction

*This phase introduces features that make the application feel more personalized and interactive.*

-   **[ ] User Ratings & Watch History:**
    -   [ ] **Implement Rating System:** Add functionality for users to rate movies (e.g., 1-5 stars) on the `MovieDetailsPage.jsx`. Store ratings in `localStorage` alongside favorites.
    -   [ ] **Create a "My Ratings" Page:** Similar to `FavoritesPage.jsx`, display a grid of movies the user has rated.
    -   [ ] **Track Watch History:** Add a "Watched" button. Store watched movies in `localStorage`.
-   **[ ] Basic AI-Powered Recommendations:**
    -   [ ] **"More Like This" Enhancement:** The current "You Might Also Like" section uses TMDB's recommendations. Augment this by creating a client-side "Because you liked..." feature based on favorite genres or actors.
    -   [ ] **Personalized Homepage:** Modify `HomePage.jsx` to show a "Recommended for You" section if the user has favorited or rated enough movies.

### Phase 3: Build Community & Social Features

*This phase requires a backend and user authentication to build social functionality.*

-   **[ ] User Accounts:**
    -   [ ] **Backend Setup:** Choose a backend stack (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI) and set up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
    -   [ ] **Authentication:** Implement user registration and login (e.g., using JWT).
    -   [ ] **Migrate User Data:** Move favorites, ratings, and watch history from `localStorage` to the user's account in the database.
-   **[ ] Social Interaction:**
    -   [ ] **User Profiles:** Create public user profile pages showing their favorite movies, ratings, and recent activity.
    -   [ ] **Watchlists:** Allow users to create and manage multiple watchlists (e.g., "Sci-Fi Classics," "Weekend Marathon").
    -   [ ] **Commenting/Reviews:** Implement a comments section on the `MovieDetailsPage.jsx` where authenticated users can leave reviews.

### Phase 4: Advanced AI & Gamification

*This phase builds on user data to deliver highly advanced and engaging features.*

-   **[ ] Advanced Recommendations:**
    -   [ ] **Collaborative Filtering:** Implement a recommendation algorithm on the backend (e.g., "users who liked this movie also liked...").
    -   [ ] **Mood-Based Filtering:** Create a "What's your mood?" feature on the homepage that suggests movies based on tags like "Exciting," "Funny," "Dramatic."
-   **[ ] Gamification:**
    -   [ ] **Achievements System:** Design and implement a badge/achievement system for completing challenges (e.g., "Watch 5 movies from the 1980s," "Rate 10 horror movies").
    -   [ ] **Leaderboards:** Create a weekly leaderboard for the most active users (e.g., most movies rated, most reviews written).

### Phase 5: Platform Expansion & Integration

*This phase focuses on making the application more accessible and integrated with other platforms.*

-   **[ ] Progressive Web App (PWA):**
    -   [ ] **Service Worker:** Add a service worker to enable offline caching of assets and basic app functionality.
    -   [ ] **Web App Manifest:** Create a `manifest.json` file to make the app installable on users' home screens.
-   **[ ] Cross-Media Integration:**
    -   [ ] **External Ratings:** On `MovieDetailsPage.jsx`, display ratings from other sources like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb by linking to them or using another API.
    -   [ ] **Chatbot/Voice Search:** Integrate a basic chatbot for conversational search (e.g., "Show me action movies from the 90s").
