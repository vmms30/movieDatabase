## ðŸš€ Technical & Performance Improvements

These changes focus on improving the codebase, performance, and maintainability.

1.  **API Key Management**:
    *   **Issue**: The TMDB API key is hardcoded in `src/services/tmdbService.js`. This is a security risk and makes it difficult to manage keys for different environments (development, production).
    *   **Suggestion**: Move the API key to a `.env` file and access it via environment variables (`import.meta.env.VITE_TMDB_API_KEY` in Vite). This keeps the key out of version control.

2.  **State Management**:
    *   **Issue**: The app currently relies on component-level state and `localStorage` for favorites. As the app grows, managing shared state (like favorites, user authentication) across components will become complex.
    *   **Suggestion**: Introduce a global state management library like **Redux Toolkit** or **Zustand**. This centralizes state logic, simplifies data flow, and makes the app easier to debug and scale. For instance, the favorites list could be managed in a global store, accessible by any component.

3.  **Component & Code Structure**:
    *   **Issue**: There are some inconsistencies, like `FavoritesPage.jsx` and `FavouritesPage.jsx`. The `tmdbService.js` file is becoming large.
    *   **Suggestion**:
        *   Standardize naming conventions (e.g., choose one spelling for "Favourites").
        *   Refactor `tmdbService.js` by splitting it into more focused files (e.g., `movies.js`, `tv.js`, `search.js`) to improve modularity.
        *   Create a dedicated `api` directory for these service files.

4.  **Error Handling & User Feedback**:
    *   **Issue**: API errors are logged to the console but not clearly communicated to the user. If an API call fails, the user sees a loading spinner indefinitely or a blank section.
    *   **Suggestion**: Implement a more robust error handling strategy. When an API call fails, display a user-friendly error message (e.g., a "Toast" notification or an error component) and provide an option to retry the action.

5.  **Lazy Loading Routes**:
    *   **Issue**: All page components are loaded upfront when the app starts. This increases the initial bundle size and load time.
    *   **Suggestion**: Implement route-based code splitting using `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`. This will "lazy load" the code for each page only when the user navigates to it, improving initial performance.

## âœ¨ Exciting Features & Advancements

These features are designed to make the website more fun, interactive, and engaging for users.

1.  **"Movie Match" Quiz**:
    *   **Concept**: A fun, interactive quiz to help users discover new movies. The quiz could ask questions like "What's your ideal movie night?" (e.g., "Cozy and heartwarming," "Edge-of-your-seat thriller") or "Pick a destination" (e.g., "A galaxy far, far away," "A magical fantasy realm").
    *   **Implementation**: Based on the answers, use the TMDB `discover` endpoint with genre, keyword, and decade filters to generate a personalized list of movie recommendations.

2.  **Gamified "Watchlist Challenge"**:
    *   **Concept**: Turn the watchlist/favorites feature into a game. Users can create a "challenge" (e.g., "Watch 5 classic sci-fi movies from the 80s") and track their progress.
    *   **Implementation**: Allow users to create themed lists and "check off" movies as they watch them. Award badges or points for completing challenges (e.g., "80s Movie Buff" badge). This encourages deeper engagement with the content.

3.  **Social Features & Community**:
    *   **Concept**: Allow users to share their favorite lists, reviews, and ratings with friends.
    *   **Implementation**:
        *   Create shareable links for user-created lists.
        *   Implement a simple user rating and review system (separate from TMDB reviews).
        *   Create a "Friend's Activity" feed where users can see what their friends are watching and rating.

4.  **Advanced & Themed Discovery**:
    *   **Concept**: Go beyond simple genre browsing with curated, themed collections.
    *   **Implementation**:
        *   **"Based on Your Mood"**: Create a section with buttons like "Need a Laugh," "Want a Good Cry," or "Mind-Bending Plots" that link to pre-filtered lists.
        *   **"Oscar Winners Circle"**: A dedicated page showcasing Best Picture winners by year.
        *   **"Franchise Universe"**: Group movies from major franchises (e.g., Marvel, Star Wars, James Bond) into a single, easy-to-navigate page.

5.  **Personalized Dashboard**:
    *   **Concept**: Once a user has favorited a few movies, create a personalized dashboard.
    *   **Implementation**: The dashboard could feature:
        *   "Because you liked [Movie A], you might also like [Movie B]." (using TMDB recommendations).
        *   "New releases from your favorite actors."
        *   A "Continue Watching" section if integrated with a streaming service API (a more advanced feature).

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Checklist

Here is a detailed breakdown of the steps required to implement the suggested improvements and features.

### Technical Improvements

**1. API Key Management**
- [ ] Create a `.env` file in the project root.
- [ ] Add `VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key` to the `.env` file.
- [ ] Add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file to ensure it's not committed.
- [ ] Update `src/services/tmdbService.js` to use `import.meta.env.VITE_TMDB_API_KEY` instead of the hardcoded key.

**2. State Management (using Zustand)**
- [ ] Install Zustand: `npm install zustand`.
- [ ] Create a new directory: `src/store`.
- [ ] Create a favorites store: `src/store/favoritesStore.js`.
- [ ] Implement the store to handle adding, removing, and loading favorite movies from `localStorage`.
- [ ] Refactor `MovieCard.jsx` to use the `useFavoritesStore` hook to check if a movie is a favorite.
- [ ] Refactor `FavoritesPage.jsx` to get the list of favorite movies from the store.

**3. Component & Code Structure**
- [ ] Standardize page names: Delete `FavouritesPage.jsx` and rename `FavoritesPage.jsx` to `FavouritesPage.jsx` (or vice-versa) to ensure consistency.
- [ ] Update the corresponding route in `src/App.jsx`.
- [ ] Create a new directory for API services: `src/api`.
- [ ] Move `src/services/tmdbService.js` to `src/api/tmdb.js`.
- [ ] Update all component imports to reflect the new path.
- [ ] **(Advanced)**: Split `src/api/tmdb.js` into smaller, more focused files like `movies.js`, `tv.js`, and `search.js` within the `src/api` directory.

**4. Error Handling & User Feedback**
- [ ] Install a toast notification library: `npm install react-hot-toast`.
- [ ] Add the `<Toaster />` component to the root of your application in `App.jsx`.
- [ ] In `tmdbService.js`, wrap API calls in `try...catch` blocks. If an error occurs, log it and re-throw it.
- [ ] In the UI components (e.g., `HomePage.jsx`), wrap the `fetch` calls in a `try...catch` block and use `toast.error("Failed to fetch movies.")` in the `catch` block.

**5. Lazy Loading Routes**
- [ ] In `src/App.jsx`, import `lazy` and `Suspense` from React.
- [ ] Convert page-level imports to use `lazy()`. Example: `const HomePage = lazy(() => import('./pages/HomePage'));`.
- [ ] Wrap the `<Routes>` component in a `<Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>` component to show a loader while pages are loading.

### Exciting Features

**1. "Movie Match" Quiz**
- [ ] Create a new page component: `src/pages/MovieQuizPage.jsx`.
- [ ] Add a new route `/quiz` in `src/App.jsx`.
- [ ] Design the UI for the quiz with a series of questions (e.g., "Pick a genre," "Choose a decade").
- [ ] Manage the user's answers in the component's state.
- [ ] Create a new function in the TMDB service that uses the `/discover/movie` endpoint, passing genres, keywords, or release years based on quiz answers.
- [ ] Create a `QuizResultsPage.jsx` to display the recommended movies.

**2. Gamified "Watchlist Challenge"**
- [ ] Update the data structure for favorites in `localStorage` or the state management store to support multiple named lists (challenges).
- [ ] Create a new page `src/pages/ChallengesPage.jsx` to display and manage challenges.
- [ ] Implement UI for creating a new challenge (e.g., a form to enter a name like "80s Sci-Fi Classics").
- [ ] Add a "Mark as Watched" checkbox or button next to each movie in a challenge list.
- [ ] Design and create a set of SVG badge components (e.g., `Badge80sFan`, `BadgeHorrorBuff`).
- [ ] Implement logic to check if all movies in a challenge are "watched" and award the corresponding badge.

**3. Advanced & Themed Discovery**
- [ ] Create a new component `src/components/ThemedCollections.jsx` for the home page.
- [ ] Design UI buttons for different moods (e.g., "Need a Laugh," "Want a Good Cry").
- [ ] For each button, create a pre-defined set of parameters (e.g., genre IDs, keywords) to use with the `/discover/movie` endpoint.
- [ ] Create a generic `ListPage.jsx` that can receive a title and API call function as props to display the themed results.
- [ ] Clicking a themed button should navigate to this list page, passing the appropriate parameters.
